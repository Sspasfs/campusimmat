If you found a bug, the first steps to do are\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item check if you\textquotesingle{}re using the latest version, and if not, upgrade to see if the problem remains unsolved,
\item search in already existing tickets to see if someone else already reported the issue.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the last release does not solve the issue and there are no existing tickets, create one using the bug report template. Be sure you provide all requested details, log entries, and whatever may be useful to understand and reproduce the issue.

If developers are not able to reproduce the issue, it may not be fixed.\hypertarget{md_public_2glpi_2_c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md628}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Features}{Features}}\label{md_public_2glpi_2_c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md628}
If you want to work on a new feature, open a ticket using the feature template, so we can discuss on it.

If you\textquotesingle{}re just asking for something to be added without doing it yourself, please consider adding (or upvoting) an enhancement on the \href{https//suggest.glpi-project.org}{\texttt{ suggestion website}}.\hypertarget{md_public_2glpi_2_c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md629}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Support request}{Support request}}\label{md_public_2glpi_2_c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md629}
