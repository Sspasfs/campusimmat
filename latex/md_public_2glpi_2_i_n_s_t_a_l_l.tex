Installation procedure is entirely automated; there is an \href{https://readthedocs.org/projects/glpi-install/}{\texttt{ installation documentation}} you should rely on.

When you are using the source code, there are extra steps, to get all third party libraries installed.

First, \href{https://getcomposer.org/}{\texttt{ download and install composer}}, a PHP dependency management tool. Second, \href{https://www.npmjs.com/}{\texttt{ download and install npm}}, a JS dependency management tool. Once done, go to the \doxylink{class_g_l_p_i}{GLPI} directory and just run\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ php\ bin/console\ dependencies\ install}

\end{DoxyCode}
